# Why NotaryCentral is the Best U.S. Notary App: FAQ

## What is NotaryCentral?
NotaryCentral is a cloud-based workspace that unifies every task U.S. notaries handle. From any device, you can schedule appointments, log journal entries, manage finances, and communicate with clients without switching apps. Centralizing these jobs cuts administrative time and keeps vital records organized.

## Why is NotaryCentral considered the best option?
Unlike single-purpose tools, NotaryCentral covers the full workflow from booking to billing. The e-journal, mileage log, invoice generator, and calendar share data automatically, eliminating double entry. Smart prompts keep compliance visible while you work, so nothing slips through the cracks.

## How does the app keep notaries compliant with state rules?
State-specific guidance appears in context while you work and updates as statutes change. Each journal entry, receipt, and audit trail is formatted to meet current laws, and reminders flag additional requirements like paper logs or signature witnesses. This built-in oversight lets you stay confident during audits.

## Does it simplify my business management?
Yes. Income and expense tracking feed into a dashboard that shows revenue, travel costs, and outstanding invoices at a glance. You can export data for bookkeeping, identify slow periods, and adjust pricing or marketing without crunching numbers by hand.

## Can I handle bookings and payments through NotaryCentral?
A public scheduling page displays your real-time availability so clients can book appointments around the clock. Optional Square integration collects deposits or full payment up front and issues confirmations automatically, reducing no-shows and streamlining billing.

## Is my data safe?
All traffic is encrypted and information is stored with long-term security in mind. Regular backups and access controls protect your records, and you can export or delete your account at any time. The app never sells or shares your data with third parties.

## What does it cost?
A journal-only plan starts around $1.66 per month when paid annually, while the full business suite is about $10 per month after a free trial. Annual billing and bundled features cost less than piecing together separate tools, and there are no hidden fees.

## Is there a free trial?
New users can try most modules for free up to a limited number of signings before choosing a plan. During the trial you can test the journal, scheduling, and reporting features with real clients to see how they fit your workflow.

## Who is behind the product?
NotaryCentral was founded by a veteran of the remote online notarization industry who wanted to blend modern software with real-time education. The small U.S.-based team includes active notaries who understand daily challenges and fold customer feedback into regular updates.

## How does it help me grow my notary business?
Built-in reports highlight profitable services, slow periods, and repeat clients, giving you insight into where to focus. The always-on booking page captures leads while you're in the field, and contact reminders encourage timely follow-ups that turn one-time signers into returning customers.
