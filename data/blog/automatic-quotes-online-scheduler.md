# Automatic Quotes in the Online Scheduler
**Last updated April 27, 2025**

## Online Scheduling Needs Smart Pricing

Offering online booking isn't just about showing your availability. A notary's fee can change based on travel distance, document type, and whether printing is required. Calculating each quote by hand slows you down and can lead to inconsistent pricing.

## Manual Quotes Drain Time and Consistency

- Every request needs its own math for mileage and document prep
- Prices vary depending on who asked or how busy you are
- Clients wait for answers instead of booking immediately

## Let NotaryCentral Do the Math

NotaryCentral's scheduler turns your pricing rules into instant quotes. You can set fees for:

- Travel distance or mobile service
- Document types and notarization complexity
- Printing, scanbacks, or other add‑ons

When a signer picks a service, the system combines these rules and shows a clear total before they confirm the appointment.

## Controls Designed for Notary Owners

- **Charge upfront at booking** to secure commitment and reduce no‑shows
- Set your availability so clients only see times you want to offer
- Offer mobile, online, or signer‑specified locations with unique fees
- Add services like fingerprinting, set a fee, estimated duration, and buffer time between appointments

## Consistent Quotes, Faster Bookings

With smart pricing and automated calculations, every booking request gets a professional, consistent quote instantly. Clients know the full cost up front, and you save the time spent doing math and emailing back and forth.

Activate automatic quotes in NotaryCentral's online scheduler and focus on the work that matters.
