# Other Appointment Types

Last updated April 18, 2025

Appointment imports are not limited to loans or basic notarizations—apostille requests, fingerprinting sessions, and any custom service type are automatically classified and placed on the calendar for tracking. The public scheduling page supports these varied services with configurable pricing and optional up‑front payments via Square, streamlining confirmation and reducing no‑shows for any appointment type.

Because journal entries, scheduling, and billing share the same workspace, notaries can track uncommon or niche appointments with the same clarity they use for core services.
