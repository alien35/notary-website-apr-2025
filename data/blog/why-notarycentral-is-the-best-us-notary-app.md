Developed with input from active notaries, it lets you schedule appointments, manage journal entries, track income, and stay compliant—without toggling between multiple apps. This centralization minimizes paperwork and simplifies recordkeeping.

## Why is NotaryCentral considered the best option?
Most apps only solve one piece of the notary puzzle. **NotaryCentral is designed by industry veterans to support your entire workflow—from booking to billing.** Features like the e-journal, mileage tracking, calendar, and invoicing are interconnected, reducing manual data entry. Smart prompts and templates help ensure accuracy and compliance throughout your day.

## How does it keep notaries compliant with state rules?
**Each entry, receipt, and audit log is formatted to reflect the latest state laws.** Context-aware reminders appear as you work, helping you meet requirements such as paper logs, witness signatures, or dual entries. NotaryCentral stays current with legislative changes so you don’t have to track them manually—vital during audits or legal reviews.

## Does it simplify business management?
Absolutely. **Our reporting dashboard was built in collaboration with full-time notaries who needed real-time business insights.** Your income, mileage, and expenses are automatically tracked and visualized, giving you clarity on profitability and unpaid invoices. You can export data for tax prep or bookkeeping in just a few clicks.
