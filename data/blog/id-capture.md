# Secure ID Capture for Notary Journals

_Last updated October 8, 2025_

Notary journals require precise record keeping. Each entry demands a signer’s name, address, ID number, and issue and expiration dates. Typing those details by hand slows you down and increases the risk of transposing digits or leaving sensitive data stored insecurely.

## The risk of manual entry

Every notary knows the stress of capturing ID information accurately. A single typo in an ID number can derail a notarization, and storing photos of IDs in your camera roll or third-party apps exposes clients to unnecessary risk.

## NotaryCentral’s compliant ID scan

NotaryCentral offers an ID capture tool built specifically for journaling. Here’s how it protects you and your signers:

- **On-device text extraction:** A photo of the ID is processed directly on your device. The image never leaves the phone, keeping the document out of the cloud.
- **Structured by AI:** Only the extracted text is sent to OpenAI, which structures the data so the journal can auto-fill fields like name, ID number, and expiration date.
- **Extensively tested:** The feature is validated with a large suite of tests to ensure reliable auto-fill results.
- **Fast turnaround:** The average processing time is about six seconds, so you get the information you need without slowing down the signing.

## Double-check for accuracy

AI can occasionally misread characters, especially on worn IDs. Review every auto-filled field against the physical ID before saving your entry.

## Disclaimer

Always verify your state’s requirements before relying on automated tools, and confirm that all journal entries are accurate before finalizing them.
