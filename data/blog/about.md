## A Mission Rooted in Innovation

My journey into notary services began when I joined NotaryCam as the second engineer. Together, we helped pioneer the first Remote Online Notarization (RON) platform. From day one, I was immersed in the legal landscape that defines our work—reading legislation, designing workflows, and building technology that complied with emerging regulations.

## The Pandemic as a Catalyst

Then the world shifted. COVID-19 created an unprecedented need for remote notarization, and we worked tirelessly to meet that demand. Yet, even as we innovated to keep people connected, it became clear that a huge piece was missing: everyday notaries lacked modern tools that truly supported them in their work. We solved for RON, but we hadn’t solved for *the notary*.

## Beyond RON: The First Iteration

After NotaryCam was acquired, I took time to reflect and launched NotaryEarth, a business management platform for notaries. It quickly found its audience, confirming the needs I saw were real. However, as users grew and needs evolved, the architecture showed its limits, particularly when trying to integrate education and compliance guidance seamlessly into the workflow. I knew we needed a new approach—a platform designed from the ground up with education and automation at its core.

## Lessons from Industry and Insight

To gain fresh perspective, I spent time working as a developer in large financial and insurance organizations. This period sharpened my engineering skills and broadened my understanding of how deeply user experience must be integrated with intelligent workflows.

## NotaryCentral: Where Education and Action Meet

NotaryCentral is the next step in this journey—a platform that fuses business tools with continuous education. I believe that notaries should never have to wonder where to find the rules or how to handle unique transactions. Instead, the guidance should be right there, integrated into the tools they use every day.

Imagine entering the details of an appointment and instantly receiving context-specific guidance—state requirements, best practices, or even tips based on the type of document. NotaryCentral is built to make that vision real.

By first offering an education module on recordkeeping that uses NotaryCentral as an example, state notary education programs can seamlessly expose notaries to the journal and other core features.

## Why Now?

The future of notarial work is hybrid, mobile, and highly regulated—and that combination demands better tools. NotaryCentral is designed to serve both solo notaries and teams, making it easier to stay compliant, streamline operations, and elevate the profession.

## The Vision

Starting NotaryCentral isn’t just about software—it’s about empowering notaries with knowledge at the moment they need it. It's about creating a future where technology amplifies the human element in notarial work, giving professionals the confidence, insight, and support to thrive.
