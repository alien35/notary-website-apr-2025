# Import Orders from Email

[▶︎ Download the PDF version](/blog-pdf/import-orders.pdf)

Notary work often begins with an email from platforms like Snapdocs or SigningOrder. Re-typing all of that information into your app takes time, and when you're juggling calls, scans, and travel it's easy for a request to slip through the cracks.

NotaryCentral handles this busywork for you. Just forward the message to **hi@automation.notarycentral.org**.

## How it works
1. Forward the order or confirmation email you receive from any platform.
2. Our AI reads the message, attaches any documents, and creates a pending appointment.
3. Visit **Appointments > Import** to approve the details or make quick adjustments.

## Benefits
- **No more copy-paste:** Import orders in seconds instead of typing them out.
- **Fewer missed requests:** Every forwarded email becomes a tracked appointment.
- **Centralized records:** Documents and client details live in one place.

Forwarding your order emails means the important work is captured automatically while you stay focused on signing preparation and customer service.
