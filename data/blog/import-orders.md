Manually entering signing details from emails or portals drains hours from a notary's week. NotaryCentral eliminates that busywork by letting you forward an order email directly into your workspace.

## How it works
1. Forward the confirmation or order request email to your unique NotaryCentral address.
2. The system parses the message and creates a pending appointment in your account.
3. Review the auto-filled details, make any edits, and approve the order with a click.

## Benefits
- **Faster turnaround:** Skip repetitive typing and import jobs in seconds.
- **Fewer errors:** Automatic parsing reduces copy-and-paste mistakes.
- **Centralized workflow:** Imported orders immediately show up alongside your existing schedule and records.

By offloading data entry, NotaryCentral lets you focus on confirming signer details and preparing for the appointment, not transcribing orders.
