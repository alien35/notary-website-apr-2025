# Never Miss a Signing Again
_Last updated October 9, 2025_

Busy days make it easy for both notaries and signers to overlook upcoming appointments. A signer who forgets to show can leave you waiting in the driveway and force a costly reschedule. Missed signings waste time, hurt your reputation, and cut into your revenue. NotaryCentral delivers smart reminders so everyone arrives on time.

## Automated reminders for notaries and signers
- Notaries receive reminder emails or push notifications before a signing
- Signers get gentle reminder emails so they don't forget their appointment
- Choose separate notification channels for yourself and your clients

## Customize timing
Set how far in advance reminders are sent. Need a nudge a day before, an hour before, or even 5 minutes before (great for Remote online notarization)? Configure reminders that fit your workflow so everyone stays on schedule.
