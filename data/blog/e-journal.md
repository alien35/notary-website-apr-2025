## FAQ

- **Can I use this e-Journal for my Remote Online Notarization appointments?**

  ✅ Yes. The app lets you indicate the platform used and a unique identifier to the signing session.

- **Are e-Journal entries tamper-evident?**

  Yes, entries in NotaryCentral's e-Journal are tamper-evident. Once an entry is saved, a secure tamper-evident hash is created, locking the record. If any part of the entry is altered later, the hash will no longer match, clearly indicating tampering.

- **How does NotaryCentral make sure my journal data doesn't get lost?**

  NotaryCentral offers several lines of defense. First, all data is automatically backed up in a second cloud provider in case an (unlikely) disaster happens to the first one. Second, we offer a "Backup" button that exports all the journal data in its original form to your device. We highly encourage you to use it for added protection.

- **How long does NotaryCentral host my journal?**

  Indefinitely. We will only remove journals upon written request.

- **What happens if I don't have internet connection?**

  You can create journal entries without an internet connection and even when you are signed out. Once you regain access to the internet you can sync your entries.
