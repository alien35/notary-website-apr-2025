# Mileage
_Last updated April 15, 2025_

Keeping a contemporaneous mileage log lets notaries deduct business travel. The [IRS standard mileage rate](https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/standard-mileage-rates) for 2025 is **70 cents per mile** for business use, and you must document the date, purpose, and distance of each trip to claim it.

## Why tracking mileage is hard for notaries
- Client appointments, courthouse visits, and supply runs often happen on the fly, making it easy to forget to record them.
- Paper logs and spreadsheets require manual entry and are prone to errors or loss.
- Missed miles add up fastâ€”overlooked trips can mean thousands in deductions left unclaimed.

## How NotaryCentral helps
- Automatically logs round-trip mileage for every scheduled appointment.
- Quickly add one-off trips, like runs to Staples for paper or toner, to stay audit ready.
- Export IRS-ready mileage reports to support your deduction at tax time.

Accurate mileage tracking maximizes deductions and keeps more of what you earn.
