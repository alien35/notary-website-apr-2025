# Loan Signings

Last updated April 18, 2025

NotaryCentral automates loan-signing management by allowing email-based forwarding of signing requests; each one is parsed and dropped into the correct calendar slot for easy tracking. Every loan signing is logged in a state-aware digital journal with built‑in receipts and tamper‑evident records, keeping compliance and documentation in one place.

A business‑health dashboard surfaces signing volume and revenue trends, helping notaries monitor performance over time. Dedicated scheduling tools provide service-based pricing, calendar sync, reminders, and optional Square pre‑payment so loan signings stay organized from booking to completion.
