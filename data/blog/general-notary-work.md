# General Notary Work

Last updated April 18, 2025

General notarizations benefit from the same automated intake: forwarding a request routes the appointment into the unified calendar without manual entry. The platformâ€™s scheduling page keeps all appointment details in one place and prevents double-booking through real-time availability and cross-device syncing.

Mileage and expense tracking feeds directly into accounting so routine jobs generate accurate cost and deduction records. Income, travel costs, outstanding invoices, and other metrics appear on a dashboard, letting notaries gauge the impact of day-to-day work at a glance.
