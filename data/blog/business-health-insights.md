Running a notary business means juggling appointments, mileage, and stacks of receipts. NotaryCentral's Business Health dashboard turns that chaos into clear insights so you always know where you stand.

## Visuals that make finances clear

The dashboard aggregates every signing fee and expense, then renders them into simple charts. Income and cost lines sit side-by-side so you can quickly spot profitable months, slow seasons, or rising travel costs. Drill-down lists let you jump from a high-level trend to the individual transaction behind it.

## Alerts that protect your bottom line

Automatic alerts highlight potential issues before they become problems. The system calls out overdue invoices, category overspending, or revenue dips. Each alert links directly to the relevant record, saving time and helping you take action without digging through spreadsheets.

## Why it matters

- **Faster decisions:** Real-time numbers replace guesswork when planning rates, marketing, or equipment purchases.
- **Tax readiness:** Categorized expenses and earnings reports keep deductions organized throughout the year.
- **Growth tracking:** Visuals reveal which services and neighborhoods generate the highest returns so you can expand strategically.

## Getting started

Activate the Accounting module and the Business Health dashboard will populate automatically as you log appointments and expenses. Within a few entries you'll gain a snapshot of your financial trajectory, plus the alerts that ensure nothing slips through the cracks.
